## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter from the perspective of the infant on the train, experiencing the heat, thirst, and rising tension as pure, synesthetic sensation.
- Create a 'found document'—a ledger page from Hacienda La Lumbre, a revolutionary pamphlet hidden in the library, or a love letter—that reveals a hidden layer of the class conflict.
- Narrate the history of the brass ashtray, from its forging to its moment of liberation, as a silent witness to decades of oppression and resistance.
- Describe a surrealist 'manifestation' of class rage in San Ignacio: perhaps the statues of founders begin to weep salt, or the streets develop a hunger that only consumes the wealthy.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of the train, the desert, and the hacienda, where hovering over locations triggers sensory descriptions (smells, sounds, textures) and fragments of character memory.
- Create a text generator that produces 'Surrealist Class Struggle Proclamations' in the style of the novel, using a vocabulary bank of bodily, geological, and archaic terms.
